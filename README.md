# PHP Null Value Handling and Loose Typing Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to null value handling and loose typing.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.php` provides a solution.

PHP's dynamic typing can be convenient, but it's essential to carefully consider how null values are handled to prevent unexpected behavior and potential errors.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when functions don't explicitly check for null values and try to perform operations that aren't defined for null.
